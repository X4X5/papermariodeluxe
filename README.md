# Paper Mario 64: Deluxe Edition
Paper Mario with a few new twists!

Built on the latest Star Rod version, Paper Mario: Deluxe Edition (Paper Mario DX, for short) aims to add QoL changes, new rooms, unused and new badges alike, and more content. It is the revival of a 2021 mod that never got off the ground. Basically, think of this as [Paper Mario: 20th Anniversary Edition](https://youtu.be/rNIgK8tbh4A), but much much less broken. In fact, I refuse to put out a stupidly broken release lol.

# FYI

Q: What's the purpose of this mod, if it's like Paper Mario 20th?

A: The point of this mod is to provide the player with a new experience in Paper Mario 64, like with any mod. However, this is a take of a "remaster" of the game, if there ever was one that came out. What differs this mod from Paper Mario 20th is the presence of Partner HP, fixed issues from 20th, new content and custom badges, and a raised difficulty. However, the rise in difficulty isn't to be worried about, this is because partners can't be injured by enemy attacks. This won't be MQ difficulty, but this will allow the player to think through moves and partner strategies a little more, and this will probably be more aimed at mid and chapter bosses.


Q: New badges? What all does this entail?

A: There will be new badges, but this does mean it'll replace vanilla ones, as well. Not to worry, this mod won't change every single badge in the game, I'll really only swap badges if the new badge is just a flashy version of the old badge.



Q: Will there be a release this time?

A: I shall work on a demo release, yes. With irl stuff going on, however, I can't promise an immediate one. But I shall bring this to as much completion as possible.



Q: Do you want help?

A: I've got all the help I need right now, thanks.



Q: Is this mod part of the [Paper Mario Jam?](https://itch.io/jam/paper-mario-modding-jam)

A: No, it is not.



Q: Will this work on an actual console?

A: Depends on which console we're talking. If your answer is the N64, then don't count on it. If you answer is "Wii", then the answer is stright up "no." Wii VC doesn't support Star Rod mods. If you're talking the Wii U, the answer is yes. However, it will be up to you to patch this mod to a Wii U WAD file. I will not distribute one as that would break copyright.
