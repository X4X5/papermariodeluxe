# Paper Mario 64: Deluxe Edition
Paper Mario with a few new twists

Built on the latest Star Rod version, Paper Mario Deluxe aims to add QoL changes, new rooms, unused and new badges alike, and more content. It is the revival of a 2021 mod that never got off the ground

# FYI

Q: Will this mod just be another hard mode mod?
A: No. This mod is meant to be enjoyed, but it's also not meant to be a walk in the park. There will be a challenge to a degree, but don't expect it to be another MQ or DSE lol


Q: New badges? What all does this entail?
A: There will be new badges, but this does mean it'll replace vanilla ones, as well. Not to worry, this mod won't change every single badge in the game, I'll really only swap badges if the new badge is just a flashy version of the old badge.


Q: Will there be a release this time?
A: I shall work on a demo release, yes. With irl stuff going on, however, I can't promise an immediate one. But I shall bring this to as much completion as possible.


Q: Do you want help?
A: At the moment, no. I'll manage on my own for now.


Q: Is this mod part of the [Paper Mario Jam?](https://itch.io/jam/paper-mario-modding-jam)
A: No, it is not.


Q: Where can I find other Paper Mario mods?
